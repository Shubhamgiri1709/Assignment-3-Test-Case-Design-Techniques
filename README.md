# Assignment 3: Test Case Design Techniques on Real App Features

## Objective
Practice multiple test case design techniques on a real-world application feature.

---

## Task Overview
- Pick a real feature (e.g. , search in Amazon).(https://www.amazon.in/)
- Write test cases using the following techniques:
  - Equivalence Partitioning
  - Boundary Value Analysis
  - Decision Table
- Create at least 5 test cases per technique.
- Deliverable: Spreadsheet or document with clearly labeled sections per technique.

## Project Setup
1. Choose a feature from a real application.
2. Prepare test cases in a spreadsheet or document.
3. Organize the test cases by technique with clear labels.

## Build Commands
*(If applicable, otherwise remove this section)*
- No build commands required for this test case design assignment.

---

## Description of Functionalities
- Test cases cover input validation, error handling, and expected output scenarios for the chosen feature.
- Each technique ensures thorough coverage of possible input combinations and boundary conditions.
- Decision tables map out inputs and expected results for complex conditions.
